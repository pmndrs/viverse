## Using Custom VRM Models

By default, the `SimpleCharacter` component uses a built-in robot avatar. You can easily replace this with your own VRM model by providing a URL to the model file.

```tsx
import { SimpleCharacter } from '@react-three/viverse'

export function MyCharacter() {
  return (
    <SimpleCharacter
      model={{
        type: 'vrm',
        url: '/path/to/your-model.vrm',
        castShadow: true,
        receiveShadow: true
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

## Adding Custom Animations

Your can replace the default animations of the `SimpleCharacter` component with files in any of these  three supported animation formats:
- **VRMA** (VRM Animation) - The native VRM animation format
- **Mixamo** (FBX) - Popular for character animations
- **GLTF** - Standard 3D format with animations

Each animation type can be configured individually:

```tsx
<SimpleCharacter
  animation={{
    walk: {
      type: 'mixamo',
      url: '/animations/walking.fbx',
      removeXZMovement: true,
      scaleTime: 0.8
    },
    run: {
      type: 'vrma', 
      url: '/animations/running.vrma'
    },
    idle: {
      type: 'gltf',
      url: '/animations/idle.gltf',
      trimTime: { start: 0.5, end: 3.0 }
    }
  }}
/>
```

You can customize any of these animation slots:

- `walk` - Walking animation
- `run` - Running animation  
- `idle` - Standing idle animation
- `jumpStart` - Beginning of jump
- `jumpUp` - Ascending during jump
- `jumpLoop` - Mid-air loop animation
- `jumpDown` - Landing animation
