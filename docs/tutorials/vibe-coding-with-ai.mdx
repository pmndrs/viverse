This tutorial shows how to collaborate with an AI coding assistant (e.g. Cursor) using the official `@react-three/viverse` docs so the AI reliably uses the right APIs and components.

## Step 1: Add the docs to your coding environment

Add the docs as a custom source so your AI can reference them while coding.

- Add this file as a custom doc source: [llms.txt](https://pmndrs.github.io/viverse/llms.txt)
- In Cursor: press `CMD+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows), search for “Add new custom docs”, and paste the URL:

```text
https://pmndrs.github.io/viverse/llms.txt
```

## Step 2: Reference the docs in your prompts

When prompting, explicitly tell the AI to use the saved docs. If you saved them as “viverse”, write prompts like:

```text
Using the viverse docs: create a simple game using @react-three/viverse.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep referencing the docs in follow-up prompts (e.g., “Using the viverse docs, add jumping to the character”) so the AI sticks to official components and APIs.

## Step 3: Run and test the game

Ask the AI to start the dev server, or run it yourself:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` to test your game.

## Step 4: Publish

Once you like your game, you can ask the AI to publish it by providing your VIVERSE email and password and referencing the VIVERSE docs so it follows the correct flow.

For a manual CLI-based workflow, see **[Publish to VIVERSE](../tutorials/publish-to-viverse.md)**.
