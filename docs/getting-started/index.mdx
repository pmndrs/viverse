```bash
npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/viverse
```

### What does it look like?

> A prototype map with the `<SimpleCharacter/>` component and its default model

<Sandpack
  template="react-ts"
  customSetup={{
    dependencies: {
      'three': 'latest',
      '@react-three/fiber': '<9',
      '@react-three/viverse': 'latest',
      '@react-three/drei': '<10'
    },
  }}
  files={{
    '/App.tsx': `
import { Sky } from '@react-three/drei'
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { Viverse, SimpleCharacter, BvhPhysicsBody, PrototypeBox } from '@react-three/viverse'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Canvas shadows style={{ position: "absolute", inset: "0", touchAction: "none" }}>
      <Viverse>
        <Sky />
        <directionalLight intensity={1.2} position={[-10, 10, -10]} castShadow />
        <ambientLight intensity={1} />
        <SimpleCharacter />
        <BvhPhysicsBody>
          <PrototypeBox scale={[10, 1, 15]} position={[0, -0.5, 0]} />
        </BvhPhysicsBody>
      </Viverse>
    </Canvas>
  )
}`}}
/>

## How to get started

> Some familiarity with
> react, threejs, and @react-three/fiber, is recommended.

Get started with **[building a simple game](../tutorials/simple-game.mdx)**, take a look at our **[examples](./examples.md)**, or follow one of our **tutorials**:

- [First person controls](../tutorials/first-person.mdx)
- [Augmented and virtual reality](../tutorials/augmented-and-virtual-reality.mdx)
- [Accessing avatar and profile](../tutorials/access-avatar-and-profile.mdx)
- [Equipping the character with items](../tutorials/equipping-items.mdx)
- [Using custom animations and models](../tutorials/custom-models-and-animations.mdx)
- [How to remove the viverse integrations](../tutorials/remove-viverse-integrations.mdx)
- [Publish to VIVERSE](../tutorials/publish-to-viverse.md)
- Building your own character controller - _Coming Soon_

## Not into react?

> No Problem

Check out how to build games using @pmndrs/viverse and only [vanilla three.js](../without-react/introduction.mdx).

This project would not be possible without the default model and default animations made by [Quaternius](https://quaternius.com/), the prototype texture from [kenney.nl](https://www.kenney.nl/), and the [three-vrm project](https://github.com/pixiv/three-vrm) from the [pixiv team](https://github.com/pixiv)!
